		<h1>The Phantom Menace</h1>
		<p>
			I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly&hellip; Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? In my experience, there is no such thing as luck.
		</p>
		<h2>A New Hope</h2>
		<p>
			Don't underestimate the Force. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. What!? Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. I call it luck.
		</p>

			<li>
				I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.

				Red Five standing by.

		<h3>The Phantom Menace</h3>
		<p>
			Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? As you wish. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.
		</p>
		<h4>Return of the Jedi</h4>
		<p>
			What?! What!? But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Red Five standing by. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.

		<h5>Revenge of the Sith</h5>
		<p>
			I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.
		</p>
		<h6>Attack of the Clones</h6>
		<p>
			Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like&hellip;suicide. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.
		</p>
		<p>
			As you wish. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck.

			Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

		</p>
		<p>
			You mean it controls your actions? The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Partially, but it also obeys your commands.
